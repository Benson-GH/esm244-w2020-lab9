```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE)

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(boot)
```

Here: add bootstrapping for CIs, etc. with visualization of resampling. 
Also add some cool data viz stuff? Like a cool map or something?
